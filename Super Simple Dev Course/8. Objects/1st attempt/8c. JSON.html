  <!-- BUILT IN OBJECTS

  JSON means = JavaScript Object Notation 
    - a syntax
    - similar to JavaScript object, but with less features
    - Does not support single quotes
    - Does not support functions

  Why use JSON if it's inferior?
    JS only makes sense in JS. JSON can be understood by almost every programming language. For this reason, we use JSON to send data between computers that uses different programming languages. 
    Also use JSON to store data

      const product2 = {
        name:'shirt',
        ['delivery-time']: '1 day',
        rating:{ //NESTED OBJECT. Object inside of an object
          stars: 4.5,
          count: 87
        },
        fun: function function1(){//FUNCTION INSIDE OF AN OBJECT is called METHOD. console.log() is an object with a function
          console.log('function inside object')
        }
      }
  
      console.log(product2)
      console.log(product2.name)
      console.log(product2['name'])//this is called bracket notation. It does the same as dot notation. It gets the value associated with the name property. Both line 17 and 18 access the string 'shirt'. We use the bracket notation when the dot notation does not work. EX:
      
      //console.log(product2.delivery-time)//this property will give us an error cause JS thinks the dash sign is a minus sign and will try a math operation, which is not the case
      console.log(product2['delivery-time'])
      //bracket let's us use properties that normally don't work with dot notation 
      
      console.log(product2.rating)
      console.log(product2.rating.count)
  
      product2.fun()
  
      console.log(typeof console)
      console.log(typeof console.log)
      
      //CONVERTING FROM JS TO JSON
      console.log(JSON.stringify(product2))//mind that the function is not showing in the console

      //CONVERTING FROM JSON TO JS
      console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(product2)))
